# Feature-Based Ensemble for Imbalanced Diabetes Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a feature-based ensemble model for handling imbalanced data in diabetes classification, using the Scikit-learn dataset.

## Features
- SMOTE + RUS preprocessing
- Feature-importance-based ensemble using Random Forest
- Comparison with 11 baseline ML/DL models + 3 resampling methods

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python feature_based_ensemble.py
```
